# Blood-Donation
This project aims to create a Blood Donation Website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Users can register, request donations, and find nearby blood donors. The future plan is to develop a React Native mobile app for easier access to blood donation services on mobile devices.
